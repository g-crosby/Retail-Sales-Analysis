# Sales

This project uses supermarket sales data from three branches over a three month span. The main goal was to perform exploratory data analysis and give a good in depth analysis of what the dataset has to offer. Gender specific differences were focused as those seemed to have to biggest discrepencies across branches, products, and months. A key aspect was the rating system that was used to generate customer happiness with the overall experience at the time of purchase. This allowed for a deeper dive into who and what type of customer was happy with thier experience. Also, there are unusual aspects of this dataset that were mentioned in the markdown that would need more data to determine the true nature of it.
