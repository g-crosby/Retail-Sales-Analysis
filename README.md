# Sales

This project used a dataset showcasing quarterly retail sales for a supermarket chain in Myanmar. The main goal was to pose six questions that could be answered from the data to hopefully drive business made decisions. 

The data only drills down to the broader product category level, but still posesses insight on customer behaviour and overall sentiment towards the stores due to the observations being unique transactions. The main focus was to determine how each branch and product line were peforming on a monthly, daily, and weekly level. Next, customers were broken down by gender, member status, payment type used, and products bought to determine who were the best customers, while also determining if there were any areas, based on ratings, that could be improved upon. Lastly, there was a brief look at possible segmentation of the customers based on a spending rank and the rating that they indiviually provided for he stores.

All of the cleansing/manipulation/exploration was done using Python with Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn.
