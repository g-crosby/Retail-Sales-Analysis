# Sales

This project uses supermarket sales data from three branches over a three month span. The main goal was to perform exploratory data analysis and give a good in depth analysis of what the dataset has to offer. More of the gender specific differences were focused as those seemed to have to biggest discrepencies across branches, products, and months. Also, there are unusual aspects of this dataset that were mentioned in the markdown that would need more data to determine the true nature of it.
